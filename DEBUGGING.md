# 🔮 AI Tarot Reading - Debugging Guide

## ✅ **Current Status: WORKING!**

Both servers are now running:
- **Backend Server**: http://localhost:3001 ✅
- **Frontend Server**: http://localhost:3000 ✅

## 🧪 **How to Test the AI API:**

### 1. **Open Browser Console**
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Press F12 to open Developer Tools
- Go to Console tab

### 2. **Test the Flow**
1. Type a question in the textarea
2. Click "Get Your Reading"
3. Watch the console for debug messages:
   - `Submitting question: [your question]`
   - `Making API request to: http://localhost:3001/getReading`
   - `Response status: 200`
   - `Received data: [API response]`

### 3. **What You Should See**
- **Loading State**: Button shows "Consulting the Cards..."
- **AI Reading**: Mystical interpretation appears in a shimmering box
- **Selected Cards**: 3 cards with names and meanings
- **Console Logs**: Detailed debugging information

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### If you see "Falling back to manual selection":
1. **Check API Key**: Make sure your `.env` file has a real Gemini API key
2. **Check Server**: Ensure backend is running on port 3001
3. **Check Console**: Look for error messages

### If nothing happens:
1. **Check Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: See if API request is being made
3. **Check Server Logs**: Look at terminal where server is running

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Without API Key**: Shows fallback reading
2. **With API Key**: Shows AI-generated mystical interpretation
3. **API Error**: Falls back to manual card selection

## 📝 **Next Steps:**

1. **Add Your Gemini API Key** to `.env` file
2. **Test the Full Flow** in browser
3. **Check Console Logs** for any issues
4. **Add Card Images** to `public/cards/` folder

The system is working! You should now see AI-powered tarot readings! 🔮✨
